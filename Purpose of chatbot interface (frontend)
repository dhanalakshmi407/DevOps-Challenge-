The purpose of the web application 
"Simple Chatbot Interface" is to
provide a basic and visually 
appealing platform where users can 
type and send messages to a chatbot 
in an easy, interactive way. Since
it is frontend only, it focuses 
purely on the user interface, using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display
messages and create a smooth chatting 
experience. This application is
designed to demonstrate how a chatbot
layout works, making it a good starting 
point for learning or later connecting 
to a backend or AI service. It aims 
to be simple, responsive, and
user-friendly for anyone to use.
